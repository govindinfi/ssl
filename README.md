# Openssl Self-Signed SSL Certificate

[![Labeler](https://github.com/govindinfi/ssl/actions/workflows/label.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/govindinfi/ssl/actions/workflows/label.yml)

A self-signed SSL certificate is one that is signed by the creator rather than a trusted certificate authority. Self-signed certificates can be as secure as trusted CA-signed SSL certificates.

Self-signed certificates are not recognized as legitimate by web browsers. When a self-signed certificate is used, the web browser warns the visitor that the web site certificate cannot be validated.

You must install a CA certificate on your workstation before it can validate self-signed certificates.
